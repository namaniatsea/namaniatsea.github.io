A quick message from the Atlantic, still heading SSW to reach the tradewinds that are forecasted to have re-established themselves on  Thursday when a low and associated cold-front off the Canaries and Madera finally crumbles and high pressure moves in north of us...  about 2500 nm to go to Antigua, all is well aboard... finished the last of our fresh meat supplies yesterday, now hoping for the fish to bite to  save us from the cans ;-) ... stay tuned for further updates...
