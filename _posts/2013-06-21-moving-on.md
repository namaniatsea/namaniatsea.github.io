After a week in Savusavu with reprovisioning and some minor boat repairs, we left our mooring there last Monday and relocated a full 4 nm  to anchor off the "Cousteau Ressort" (run by one of the famous  diver's off-springs), close to the entrance to Savusavu Bay. 

Only 4nm away but it felt a world apart from Savusavu, swinging at anchor again over turqouise water... From there we left early (0430!) on  Thursday to make the 45nm to the east into Viani Bay before the sun got too low to see the coral heads flanking the entrance to that bay.  It turned out to be a very nice sail, close reaching and tacking over almost flat waters and under a sunny sky.

We're now (Friday, 21JUN) anchored here in Viani Bay together with about 10 other boats. It's a beautiful big bay and a staging place for  some famous dives in the passage between Vanua Levu and the off-lying island of Taveuni. We have booked a 2-tank dive with a local  operator for tomorrow and are very curious what we will see. We'll let you know....
