We are in the Tobago Cays again, this time on our way back up north.  We arrived yesterday afternoon after a very nice day sail from Tyrell  Bay, Carriacou, and had a very special greeting:  Right after we had dropped our anchor there were two big sea turtles (Nicky is still  working on identifying the specific type with his little field guide), popping their heads out right next to our boat.  It turned out that they  belonged to a group of 5-6 turtles who were feeding off a grassy patch on the seabed a short distance from our anchor spot. They did not  mind when we snorkled over to watch them and just kept munching away (guess they are used to visitors...).  And just after everyone as  back on the boat we saw two sting rays passing by us across the seabed (we are anchored in about 3m and you can clearly see the to the  bottom).  Definitely a lot more wild life during our first hour here than during our entire previous visit about 10 days ago.

The evening was then taken up with watching a total lunar eclipse that unfolded between 10pm and 1am lat night.  A very special sight to  watch it over the Atlantic surf breaking on the reef ahead of us...

Today we look forward to reuniting with our friends from Sea Bright here in the Cays and then spend another day here before continuing  north towards Bequia where we will need some minor sail repairs.  

Arearea whose company we enjoyed in the western Med has now left the Cape Verde Islands and we hope to establish radio contact with  them soon and look forward to seeing them over here in about 2 weeks time as well.  Stay tuned for further uodates...
