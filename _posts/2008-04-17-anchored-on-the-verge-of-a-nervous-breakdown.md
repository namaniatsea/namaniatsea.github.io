Our anchorage here in Bahia de Almodovar (any  relation to the the Spanish movie director yet to be verified) is stunningly beautiful - a bit of a combination between Tobago Cays (anchored  behind a reef), Tyrell Bay/Carriacou (largely undeveloped bay) and Les Saintes (view of St. Thomas lights in the distance) - and all that  shared with only one other sailboat!  Off to Fajardo on Puerto Rico's east coast tomorrow, update and pictures to follow...
