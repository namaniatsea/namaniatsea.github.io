Two "firsts" for Namani: The first time Namani is below 20 degrees south lattitude and the first time we're anchored in a place where our  chart only shows a solid reef. We're in a perfectly sheltered little nook inside the reef that surrounds Oua Island - the access to which is  mentioned in an old sailing guide to Tonga's Ha'pai Group and which is clearly visible and easy to navigate once you're there.

We had a beautiful evening yesterday at Luangahu Island, together with Victoria: dinner at a  driftwood fire on the beach on our private little island, the three boys baking  "bread on a stick" over the fire, and everyone enjoying the moment. Today we  needed to move though, as the weather is changing, with a weak low and  associated front/trough approaching from the west. The wind has already started  to turn from the east to the north and is forecast to go through NW-W-SW-S over  the coming 2-3 days before returning to the prevailing easterlies. So we moved  20nm south to one of the few anchorages with decent shelter from the west in the  Ha'pai Group. Shortly after we had dropped anchor here, Santa Paz, a Brazilian  boat we had met in Suwarrow, entered the little lagoon here and we had a nice  reunion this afternoon with Sandra, Lucas and their daughters Julie and Clara.  We hope to re-connect with Victoria in a few days time (they had stopped at  another island along the way).

We really enjoy the sailing here in the Ha'pai Group, which provides a nice  contrast to the very compact Vava'u Group further north. Islands are more spread  out with nice stretches of unspoiled wind and sailing between them. Also, a much  lower density of boats: No charter base, everything is spread across a much  larger area and many boats pass through here relatively quickly on their way to  Tongatapu, the main island further south. Based on the current weather outlook  there will not be a decent window for heading down to Minerva Reef and on to New  Zealand before early November. Good for us as it gives us a few more days to  enjoy the islands up here. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
