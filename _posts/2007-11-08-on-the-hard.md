The Blue Water Rally website (see link to the right) has a picture of Namani being lifted out of the water yesterday (look under "Stop Press" on the BWR site).  We're putting on 2 new coats of antifoul today (thanks to the help of Jo and Dave from Seabright), before going back into the water tomorrow afternoon. Stay tuned...
