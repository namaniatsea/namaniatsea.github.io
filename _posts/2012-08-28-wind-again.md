The wind started to fade this morning (Monday) and even the Parasailor gave up by lunchtime. We indulged in four hours of motorig before  the wind started to slowly come back from ESE this afternoon. From the weather charts it looks like we just skirted aorund the northern end  of a piece of South Pacific Convergence Zone that had drifted towards French Polynesia. Boats at anchor to the SW off Maupiti reported  gusty rain squalls on the radio this morning which we seem to have dodged so far. Now we're back to broad reaching under genoa at a  leisurely 4.5kn with a forecast of stronger wind to build over the next 48 hours before tapering off again. About 400nm to go to Suwarrow;  all is well aboard, stay tuned...
