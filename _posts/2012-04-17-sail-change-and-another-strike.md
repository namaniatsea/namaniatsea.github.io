The wind backed a bit over the past 24 hrs and we have finally changed to our "down wind genoa" today. It's actually two identical 115%  genoas, sewn on the same luff tape. We now fly one to either side with the at about 170deg on the port quarter. All in all it took us almost  two hours to wrestle down the big single genoa we had flown so far and to hoist, set up and pole out the new one, but it was well worth  the effort. Much better ride now and good speed. We got the sail last summer from Bay View Rigging in Yarmouth, ME. So far we had only  played with it on short stretches since we never had real down-wind conditions. So we're quite happy that it seems to be working well now.

Also caught another Mahi mahi today just before dinner. We actually had one on each of the two lines we were trolling but one  got away.  Good thing, because one was already plenty of food. We'll only troll one line from now on...

All is well aboard, stay tuned...
