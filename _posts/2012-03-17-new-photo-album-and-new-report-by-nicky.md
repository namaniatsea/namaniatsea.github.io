Finally (we heard you, Dave ;-), some new photos from the Panama - Galapagos passage. As the Sailblogs photo manager is pretty clumsy we will post the photos on Picasa from now on (the old ones will stay in the Sailblogs Gallery, see link to the right). Click <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/09APanamaToGalapagos?authuser=0&feat=directlink">here</a> for the new album.

Nicky has also posted a new school report about life on a sailboat in the open ocean. It can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/namaniatsea/nicky-s-page/life-on-a-sailboat">here</a>.
