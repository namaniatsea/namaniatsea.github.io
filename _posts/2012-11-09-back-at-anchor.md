Moved back out to the anchorage this afternoon, after some last re-provisioning in town - nice to be out of the harbor again. Conditions are  easing for the boats underway which is good. We're tentatively eying a Wednesday departure when the wind is forecast to pick up again a  bit. All is well aboard stay tuned...
