Had a very nice hike up Maupiti's little peak today with Victoria and Aspasia. Re-anchored in the afternoon close to the pass to be able to  see the manta rays here tomorrow morning before leaving for Suwarrow. Weather forecast looks pretty good with some strong easterlies for  the first 36..48 hrs, then a low move through to the south causing some light and variable up here for about 24 hrs before good wind  should set in again. We'll see...
