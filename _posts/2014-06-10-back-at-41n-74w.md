  We're back on the US Coast now, about a month after we left Namani and Australia in early May. We had a wonderful trip back with a few stops to see many old (and some new) friends along the way.  Many thanks Margaret and Steve; Fenny, Howe and Elizabeth; Ken and Sylvia; Catherine and Chris; Sheila, Bill and Cecille; Sabina, Graham, Ethan and Lynden; Laura, Gary, Aiden, Gerda and Jack - it's been wonderful seeing you - you have all spoiled us with your hospitality!

We'll head up to Maine later this week - back to where we started this trip in September 2011.
