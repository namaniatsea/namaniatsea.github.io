Slipped our mooring in Fort Pierce at high tide around noon today and had some very nice sailing so far...reached the Gulf Stream conveyor  belt early last night with a few hours of 10 kn speed over ground... wind is dying now, so we're back to 6...7 kn SOG. Current position  (0500 local time) is 29-25.6N 079-47.9W... all is well aboard.
