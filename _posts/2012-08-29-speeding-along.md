Wind continued to build today (Tuesday) as forecast. By now we have a solid 20kn+ from ESE, making for speedy progress - at least by  our modest standards. Made contact with Astarte on the radio this morning. They're close to Niue, expecting to reach the island sometime  during this night and planning to enter tomorrow morning. Apparently they had a little POST-Net reunion (the SSB net we had on the  Galapagos-Marquesas passage) in Suwarrow with Katydid, Adventure Bound and Wigwam all being anchored there with them. Who  knows, we might still catch Robin on Katydid before he leaves.

All is well aboard, stay tuned...
