Back in St. Pierre for one night... tomorrow will be another 50+ nm leg to Portsmouth/Dominica from where we will leave for Guadeloupe on  Monday to meet with Jez and Tab who will sail with us for two weeks, first in Les Saintes/Guadeloupe and then up to English Harbour in  Antigua ... Finally fixed the defect Y-valve on the toilette this afternoon - no more backflow from the holding tank (so we hope...) ... weather  is forecasted to settle down a bit with relatively low winds for the first half of next week... don't mind the wind but will appreciate the seas  going down a bit between the islands ... more once we reach Point-a-Pitrè in Guadeloupe.
