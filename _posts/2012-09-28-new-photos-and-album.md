For a few hours this morning we had a decent internet connection and were able to upload some new photos. We added pictures from Maupiti to the Society Islands album (see <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/09GSocietyIslands?authuser=0&feat=directlink">here</a>, last 10 pictures, plus the one above this post). We also added a new album with photos from Suwarrow (see <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/09HSuwarrow?authuser=0&feat=directlink">here</a>). Enjoy!
