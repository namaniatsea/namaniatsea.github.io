After two weeks in Opua we weighed anchor at midday today (Saturday, 08NOV) and moved out into the Bay, to Urupukapuka. The  unsettled weather of the past few days has gone and we enjoyed a nice sail and a beautiful anchorage this afternoon and evening. 

We enjoyed our stay at Opua (even though the 2nd week was largely weather imposed), but is definitely nice to be "out" again. Now we're  looking forward plan to meeting Seabright at Great Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf during their vacation next week.
