Dropped the hook about  noon today, in Abrahams's Bay off Mayaguana - an unbelievably undeveloped place for an official port of entry  to the Bahamas - very beatiiful. Logged just over 800 nm from Charleston, SC and it was a hard slog, essentially sailing close hauled  ever since we came out of the main axis of the Gulf Stream last Saturday. Everything is solidly salt coated from constant spray and waves  over bow - so we hope for some rain squalls tonight to clean things up. We're officially in the tropics now (22°22' North) and the water  temperature has positively improved since Maine... Ready to catch up on some sleep now... we hope to continue towards Jamaica next  Tue/Wed - weather permitting - stay tuned...
