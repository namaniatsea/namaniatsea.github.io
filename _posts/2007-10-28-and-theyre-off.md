Yes, we're off!  At 0830 this morning we slipped our moorings at Marina Bay in Gibraltar and went to Europa Point where the Blue Water  Rally's official start took place at 1000. While Europa Point had its usual 4m+ waves we are now out of the Strait, off Morocco's  northwestern corner, sailing downwind, wing-on-wing with poled out genoa over flat seas... it doesn't get much better!  About 550 nm to go  to Lanzarote - stay tuned for further upates...
