We finally managed to sort through our photos from our six months in New Zealand and put a selection online. The new album can be found under <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/09LInNewZealand?authuser=0&feat=directlink" title="NZ Album">this link</a>.

On other news it currently looks that we won't be leaving for Australia by the end of this week. Latest forecasts have a low sitting in the Tasman Sea at a time when we would be about half-way to Coff's Harbour (see picture above). Wind and waves on the nose for the second half of the trip? We'll probably pass on that one... In any case will leave Noumea today to anchor out again. Update to follow...
