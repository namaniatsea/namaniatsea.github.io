Making good progress but have been beating to windward pretty much ever since we left the Gulf Stream. Good for speed, bad for  comfort. .. it did however also produce Namani's best ever 24hr run at 152nm (that tells you how slow we usually go ...).. Now we hope to  make landfall either in Mayaguana tomorrow (if wind permits sufficient easting) or Great Iguana on Friday morning (both in the SE  Bahamas).  A bit tired, but all is well aboard... stay tuned...
