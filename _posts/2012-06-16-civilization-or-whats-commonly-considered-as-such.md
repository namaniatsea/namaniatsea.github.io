We arrived in Tahiti yesterday morning (Friday, 15JUN) and are now berthed at Marina Taina, just SW of Papeete. On the way in we  realized that we had been sailing next to Astart&#233; the night before, at a 3-4nm distance. LOTS of boats around, very busy, a funny contrast  to the last 6 month. Made a short excursion to the famous (among cruisers) Carrefour here... very nice, but also made us realize that we  didn't really miss anything much during the past months. Had a very nice dinner out last night when Karen and Larry from Panta Rhey  walked by  - very nice to catch up with them (and an awesome rasberry cake for desert aboard Panta Rhey - thanks Karen and Larry!).  Now we have to source some spares before Nicky and Papa head off to Germany tomorrow night. Stay tuned...
