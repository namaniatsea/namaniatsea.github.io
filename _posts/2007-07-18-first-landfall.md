Jus a quick update since I'm using a public internet terminal with an awful keyboard...
Wwe made our first passage from Olbia/Sardinia to Filicudi in the Aaeolian Islands (north of Siciliy) and covered the 270 nm in about 65 hours at a leisurely pace with some very nice sailing unde starry skies in light winds.  Nicky got the full program and saw dolphins, a wale annd some big ships and had a good time on the boat.  After our arrival in the Aeolian we stayed for one night in Filicudi, then spent a night in a marina on Lipari to take on water and replenish annd are now at anchor before Vulcano where we hiked up the very vulcano tis morning.  Next stop: Reggio Calabria - stay tuned...
