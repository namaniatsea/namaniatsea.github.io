We're under way again, going WNW towards the NW Bahamas where we hope to arrive sometime Wednesday or Thursday... current  position is 22-10N 071-49W ... looking at the weather forecasts we're definitely glad we did not go via Bermuda as the low pressure  systems and associated fronts still come off the US east coast in quick succession ... all is well aboard - stay tuned for further updates ...
