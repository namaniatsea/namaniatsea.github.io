Moved to Ilot Tautau on the west side of Tahaa this morning. In a light WNW wind we were even able to sail up to the anchorage inside  the lagoon. We found Topaze and Sambe already at anchor here, and E Capoe arrived an hour later, making the kids' complement  complete again. All of us went for a little snorkel "expedition" in the "Coral Gardens", located in a shallow pass between two motus. A  wonderful maze in the coral with quite a few fish made for a fun afternoon.

Now were planning to sail over to Bora Bora tomorrow with everyone else. If we're lucky we can even catch up with Heike, Kai and their  two boys on Victoria there. Stay tuned...
