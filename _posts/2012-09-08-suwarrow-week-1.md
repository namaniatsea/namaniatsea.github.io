Today marks the end of our first week on Suwarrow which has quickly established itself as one of our favorite landfalls.. Healthy and  beautiful coral, lots of fish and an island only for the cruisers anchored here (admittedly quite a few at times) - plus Anthony  ("Ants") and  Harry, the two National Park wardens on the island. We spend our days snorkeling and diving (plus some school work and boat  maintenance/repairs, as always...), usually followed by kids' playtime on the beach, and occasionally followed by a potluck dinner. Lots of  boats with children aboard (great for Nicky and us). Topaze and Hero left today, but Victoria and E Capoe should get here tomorrow,  keeping the "kid count" high. While some of the snorkeling is a 2-3nm dinghy ride away (thanks to Samba for the ride!) we also had a very  nice dive just off Merilelu, the boat of Finnish/Dutch friends anchored about 100m behind us. In 15-20m we had lots of nice coral and fish  plus some sleeping white tip sharks on the bottom. By now we've got used to the presence of sharks almost everywhere and all the time.  Mostly small black tips, plus some white tips and lemon sharks. They don't mind us it seems and we're slowly developing a reciprocal  attitude... 

Our current plan is to spend another 5-7 days here, before heading to Tonga with a stop in Niue. Stay tuned...
