Just about to cross 30S lattitude, marking the start of our final 350nm to Opua/NZ. After still having flown the Parasailor in light airs during  the day, we now have plenty of wind again. It's even from the right direction, as it has just shifted from NE to N as we're transiting a front.  These fresh northerlies on the backside of a high should stay with us for the next 36hrs. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
