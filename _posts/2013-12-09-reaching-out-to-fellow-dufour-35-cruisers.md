Over the past few years this blog has brought us in touch with a few fellow owners of an original Dufour 35 of Namani's vintage (the series was built in the 1970's and early 80's).  We've enjoyed the exchanges and they have often been helpful as a sounding board for boat questions regarding modifications and repairs. Why re-invent the wheel if someone else has already thought of a good solution?

In order to facilitate an easy flow of information among D35 owners we have now set up a Yahoo mailing list. The idea is simply to be able to reach out to fellow owners to share boat-related information and bounce off questions and ideas. So if you're another proud owner of an original Dufour 35, interested in joining that mailing list: send us a message - either as a comment to this post or on our home page (namaniatsea.net) under "Contact and Feedback" - and we'll send you the details on how to join.
