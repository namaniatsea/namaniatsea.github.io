Anchored off Deshaies in NW Guadeloupe and will likely stay here tucked away until the weekend as there is some big northerly swell  coming through this area over the next day... Not a bad spot to be stuck for a couple of days... will also give us the chance to explore  some of the interior of Guadeloupe by car with Jez and Tab ... stay tuned for further updates...
