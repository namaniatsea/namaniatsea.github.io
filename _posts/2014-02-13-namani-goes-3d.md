Nicky just completed a two-week project of developing a 3D-model of Namani and animating it into a short video clip.  Working from photos and some blueprint drawings, he used an Open Source software called '<a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a>' to develop and animate the model.

Check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/namaniatsea/nicky-s-page/namani-goes-3d">Nicky's page</a> to watch the 30 second long animated video clip.
