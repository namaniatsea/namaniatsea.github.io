.. in very small increments. Have moved a full 12nm today to a new anchorage that everyone refers to as the "Swimming Pool" in the  Cayas Hollandes. Conveniently, there seems to be re-use of names for individual islands between the different island groups. So we are  again anchored off an island named Banedup. Originally, we had planned to go to Coco Banderos today (a full 5 nm further!), but we  reckon we have a higher chance of intercepting the fruit & veggie boat here (if it does indeed come ...).

After having averaged1000 nm / month during Sep/Oct/Nov, we now seem to be down to 10-15 nm / week  - a marked and welcome  change. It will pick up again soon enough...
