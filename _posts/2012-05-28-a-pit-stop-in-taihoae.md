After another very nice day yesterday (Saturday) with Samba, E Capoe and Topaze (four boats incl. Namani and eight kids between  them!), we left the "Baie du Contrôleur" this morning with a bit of a heavy heart. We would have loved to stay a few days longer with the  other boats but in order to make Nicky's and Papa's flight back to Germany from Tahiti on 17JUN *and* to leave at least a week for staying  in the Tuamotus on the way to Tahiti we had to start to make tracks...

We stopped in Taihoae (biggest town in the Marquesas) and saw a lot of our former neighbors from other islands there (Malamock,  Merilelu, Katydid, Floe, Venus, Moin, Ashanti, ...). We also heard that the anchorage there had turned quite rolly over the past two nights.  Hence - with stores being closed tomorrow ("Pfingstmontag") anyway, we follwoed Merilelu's and Floe's example, and just moved on to  Daniel's Bay, about 4 miles further to the west. A more comfortable spot with very beautiful scenery. Will hike to the world's 3rd (?)  highest waterfall tomorrow morning, do some boat jobs, and then return to Taihoae Tuesday morning for provisioning, fuel, cooking gas,  ..If things go well, we'll leave for the Tuamotus on Thursday this week. Stay tuned...
