After some favorable winds and keeping the "pedal to the metal" for the past 36 hrs we now hope to be in Antigua tomorrow (Wednesday)  late afternoon.  The final sprint is taking a bit of a toll on boat and crew especially with having had to hand steer in big and confused seas  with the boat going 7+ knots.  Doing a 3-hour shift of that at night leaves you somewhat jaded especially while it is hard to get decent sleep  during the off-watch as the boat is tossed around in the waves.  Anyway, Jolly Harbour in Antigua is now (111600DEC boat time =3D utc-4)  only 130 nm away and we are sure looking forward to arrival after 26 days at sea!  Next update from Antigua - stay tuned...
