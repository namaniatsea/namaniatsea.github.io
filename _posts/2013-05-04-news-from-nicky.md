We put three new school reports from Nicky up on "Nicky's Page" at namaniatsea.net. If you're interested, you can read about his recent 2-week <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/namaniatsea/nicky-s-page/opua-school-visit-report">visit to the local school in Opua</a>, a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/namaniatsea/nicky-s-page/auckland-museum-report">visit to the Auckland Museum</a> at the end of March, and his experience at a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/namaniatsea/nicky-s-page/motuihe_volunteering">volunteering project on Motuihe Island</a> in the Hauraki Gulf back in February.
