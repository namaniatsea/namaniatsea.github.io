We had a post with the same title during our Atlantic crossing about five years ago...here we are again, this time trying to get into the South  Pacific trade winds. After clearing the southernmost islands of the Galapagos on a tack to SSE during Monday night, we tacked to the west and made good  progress until Tuesday (03APR, "Day 2"), 5pm local time, along 2°S. After that we had a bit of a frustrating 24 hours during which we  logged 120nm, only to end up 6nm west of our 02PAR 1700 position on 03APR at 5pm... between beating into shifting 20kn headwinds, a  now contrary current (setting east at 1+kn) and heavy rain, it looked like we were sailing against a wall that blocked any progress to the  SW - we actually kept tacking through 160°... Hence, by 11am on Wednesday we had decided to forget about any progress to the SW at  this latitude and to stay on a SE'erly tack until we get into better wind (i. e. something that resembles SE'erly trade winds).  The wind dropped and the rain stopped sometime on Wednesday afternoon and since Wednesday night we've had a mix of motoring and  sailing in light winds towards SSW. We had a relaxing Thursday (05APR), catching up on some sleep  and enjoying life on board Namani.  We even took our first sun sights (only partial cloud cover!) and shot some stars/planets earlier tonight (full moon with a decent horizon  and Mars + some bright stars visible). It now (4:30am local on Friday) looks like we will have to go to about 6° S to get into better wind -  about another 24hrs. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
