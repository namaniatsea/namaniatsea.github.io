While we have still about 120nm to go as of this Sunday morning we are now meandering our way through the southern islands of Fiji. First  sight of land this morning was Moala, a little island now about 15nm to starboard. We can also see the top of Viti Levu ahead to port. Plans have changed once again and we will go to Savusavu as originally planned (rather than Levuka - see one of the recent posts).  Despite SAVUSAVU being busy, boats who already arrived have reported on the radio that "space will be found". Two boats from our little  SSB net, Kira and Momo have altready arrived yesterday (Saturday) afternoon. They are currently drifting in Savusavu Bay to delay entry  into Savusavu until Monday morning in order to avoid paying steep overtinme fees for customs officials checking boats in during the  weekend. Since Thursday we have had picture perfect sailing, broad reaching in a steady 15kn under blue skies with a few tradewind clouds. We  should get into Savusavu tomorrow around mid-day. Stay tuned... PS: Have relaunched our revived wind/tow generator in tow mode yesterday - works like a charm, power in abundance now ;-)
