We covered our first stretch of the ICW today, from Beaufort to Belhaven - 70 miles down, 135 to go to Norfolk.  This morning we had  made radio contact with our friends from Arearea. More than a month after seeing them last in Puerto Rico we now have caught up with  them again here in Belhaven and had a very nice re-union tonight - Nicky could hardly contain his excitement about seeing his buddy  Dante again (the picture above shows him with Arearea's crew in Belhaven)!  We now plan to move in tandem up to Norfolk.

The ICW defintely does have its own appeal.  We're not keen to cover the full 1,000 miles of it anytime soon but the stretch we've seen  today in North Carolina offers some very nice scenery and provides a somewhat different boating perspective.  Stay tuned for further  updates...
