We arrived in Bizerte/Tunesia on Tuesday 11SEP after an uneventful 2-day passage from Malta.  Ironically, we had to come to North-Africa to feel cool again (still at 25°C though...).  We will likely stay here another day and then take off for Menorca (possibly with a stopover on Sardinia, depending on the wind) as soon as the weather is favourable.  Yesterday an American boat with two small children (2-years and 6-months) tied up next to us so we can start a temporary little play group. Next update probably from Menorca - stay tuned...
