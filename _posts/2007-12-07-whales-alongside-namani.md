Wow - an unusual view this morning: shortly after sunrise we had a pod of 4-5 whales (type to be determined, each one approx the length  of our boat) swimming approx. 20m off Namani's beam before crossing our bow and disappearing into the distance.  Quite an awesome  sight - if a bit close for comfort though...  With a good 24 hr run behind us and approx. 625 nm to go we're still hoping for 12DEC arrival -  stay tuned...
