A post not about Namani but about another sailor this time...  Nick Jaffe is a young Australian with some German ancestry. He worked in Germany in the early 2000s and chose to travel back to his native Australia by single-handing a 26-foot Contessa from Europe to "Down under" between 2006 and 2009.  I had followed his travels on his <a href="http://www.bigoceans.com">blog</a> and admired his determination to do this with virtually no prior sailing experience and on a very tight shoestring budget.

Some film and music making friends of his have now put together a feature length movie about Nick's journey which is about to be <a href="http://http://www.betweenhome.com/">released on the web</a>.

If you're interested - here's the trailer:
