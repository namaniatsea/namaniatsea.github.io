Hello from Prickly Bay at the southwestern end of Grenada... arrived here today after a 40 nm sail from Carriacou and are looking forward to  exploring some of the island.  This will be the southernmost point of our trip (we chose our anchor spot to stay just below 12° N...).  All is  well aboard, more detailed update to follow over the next few days - stay tuned
