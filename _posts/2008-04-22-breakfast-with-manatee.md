We're in Puerto Rico proper now, in a marina on the east coast of the island.  We will likely stay here for a week or so to work down the Namani job list again and to have Markus go to the Bahamas to get a visa for the US (that's a long story to be told in some other post...). Nana's mother is visiting for the week so we also enjoy some family time together - recently joined by a manatee that was swimming around the marina one morning (see picture above). "Swimming around" exaggerates the manatee's speed  - it was barely moving.  We heard they were slow but now we know they're really sllllooooowww...
