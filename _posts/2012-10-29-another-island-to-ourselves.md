Weighed anchor at Oua Island this morning to go about 15nm to the SW to Nomuka Iki. When we left Oua the sea looked like a duck  pond with absolutely no wind and we were afarid we would have to motor the whole way. Luckily some local thermal wind filled in a bit later  and we had a nice time tacking on flat seas.  We now again share an island with Victoria (who had already spend one night here) but no  one else. The forecast has basically no wind until Thursday night when we plan to head south to Tongatapu to clear out of Tonga. Until  then we have a few boat jobs to do here and the coral and marine life looks interesting enough to keep us occupied. All is well aboard,  stay tuned...
