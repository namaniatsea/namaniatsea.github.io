Our Caribbean cruising has officially started today, with a day sail to France - more exactly, to one of its overseas territories, namely  Guadeloupe.  After a very nice 43 nm sail from English Harbour/Antigua we arrived at Deshaies at 1700 local today where we are now at  anchor.  We had spent New Years Eve aboard Seabright, moored just outside Jolly Harbour/Antigua.  New Years Day was then spent at a  beach BBQ with the crews from Hakuna Matata, Heidenskip, and Seabright before we sailed to English Harbour on the southern coast of  Antigua on 02JAN.  We anchored there just for one night, mainly to pick up a part for our windvane selfsteering we had made at a welding  shop there.  We cleared out of Antigua last night and then finally left this morning, heading south.  We very much enjoyed our time on  Antigua but are now also looking forward to making our way south towards Grenada.  Stay tuned...
