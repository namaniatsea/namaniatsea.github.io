Weighed anchor at 0845 this morning and started our sail to the Galapagos. After a few hours of light westerly winds a steady breeze from the north settled in and we had a great afternoon, sailing under Parasailor and Hydrovane. Had a big school of spotted dolphins play with us before sunset. Switched back to genoa for the night and are now sailing under stary skies, with the Big Dipper behind us and the  Souther Cros ahead of us. Seas a bit confused as we pass the edge of the Continental Shelf, but nothing big. Nicky is asleep in the  cockpit, all is well aboard.
