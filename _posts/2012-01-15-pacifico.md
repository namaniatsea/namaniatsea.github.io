A little more thn four years ago we wrote a blog entry "Bye bye Mediterranean, hello Atlantic". Now it's "Bye bye Atlantic, hello Pacific".

 At about 1230 local time today we exited the Miraflores Lock and Namani moved into the Pacific! We had an easy transit today, tying up  alongside one of the Canal tourist boats in each of the locks, which also made for a quick transit. Thanks very much to our Canal Advisors,  Carlos (Saturday, Gatun Locks) and "Astro" (Sunday, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores Locks) and to our great line-handler crew, Sylvia, Victor  and Hobin. Sorry you didn't get the full "monkey fist experience" but you were great crew to have aboard in any case! 

 Now we will stay here for a few days to run errands in the city and potentially also do another transit on Ann Lucia as line-handlers. 

 PS: Nana's brother Paul took some screenhots of the Canal webcam, showing Namani in Miraflores Lock. We'll post these when we have  internet access again.
