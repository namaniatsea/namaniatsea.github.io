Sailed back to Portland this morning to drop off Laura at the airport there. Laura may not have had the sailing vacation she expected but she sure will have a story to tell: Running aground (on our first departure down the Royal River - luckily lifted out by the rising tide within a few miniutes), towing a motorboat out of fuel off the rocks at Moshier Island (on our return to Yankee Marina), watching hurricane Irene pass by (by then downgraded to tropical storm) - and finally two very fine sailing days. Now we plan to sail to The Basin tomorrow and then make our way up to Penobscot Bay.
