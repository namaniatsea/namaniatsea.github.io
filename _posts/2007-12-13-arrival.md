We finally did arrive at Jolly Harbour at approx. 1330 local yesterday (Wed, 12DEC)... very nice place, very nice to be on land again and  see the other rally boats & crews.  Unfortunately, Peter had to leg it last night already to catch his flight back to the UK - 26 days at sea and  6 hours at the destination, that's got to be some kind of a record... Very nice to meet Ralf here who will be staying with us until Sunday.  Today will mostly be taken up with cleaning up and then it will take a  couple of days to "decompress" - right now it still feels as if we had just arrived here after a long day sail...  In any case: everyone is well, Antigua is beautiful (I forgot how nice the Caribbean can be...) and we look forward to a relaxing week at  Jolly Harbour.  Pictures and movies to follow later - stay tuned
