Anchored off Chapera in Las Perlas and planning to leave for the Galapagos tommorwo morning. Came here yesterday from Balboa to get  the last preparation activities done (cleaning hull and prop again, swapping our genoa for the bigger one, ...). Cleaning the hull turned into  a bigger challenge than expected as there are quite a few stingy jelly fish around. Nana had to dig out the long underwear to get full body  protection in the water... Our friend Bill arrived on Saturday and will be joining us again for this leg. We hope to arrive in the Galapagos by  10MAR, wind permitting. All is well aboard, stay tuned.

PS: Picture above shows one of the many Pelicans around us here
