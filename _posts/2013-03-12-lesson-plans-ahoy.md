One of the projects that we finally completed during our two weeks up in Whangaroa was converting Nana's "Lesson Plans Ahoy! to an eBook/Kindle format, which is now available at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lesson-Plans-Ahoy-ebook/dp/B00BNCP94Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1363080391&sr=8-2&keywords=lesson+plans+ahoy">amazon.com</a>. So, after two print editions you can now enjoy the 3rd edition on your favorite e-reader (a version in EPUB format will follow shortly).
