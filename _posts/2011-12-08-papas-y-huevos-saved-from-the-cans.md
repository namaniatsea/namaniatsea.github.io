While we knew that food supplies are not easy to come by in most of the San Blas Islands, things turned out to be even more scarce than  we had expected. Other boaters who have been in the area for while told us that a skiff with some fruits and veggies comes through the  more frequented anchorages approximately once a week. However, by the time we arrived here a week ago, everyone was already  eagerly awaiting the elusive fruit & veggie boat but there was no sign of it. Meanwhile, we were getting plenty of fresh water from rain  showers and some fresh fish from passing fishermen (including a four pound tuna for $2) but our fresh fruit supplies were down to a sad  collection of five onions, a handful of limes, and three sweet potatoes. Until today - salvation! A boat with eggs and potatoes showed up  and allowed us to restock at least those items. It doesn't take much to make us happy! 



After a week of splendid relaxation here in the East Lemmon Keys, we'll probably move to another anchorage (Cocos Banderos) tomorrow,  planning to leave the San Blas for Colon by the end of the month. It's also time to work down the job-list on Namani again - the anchor  windlass will be next. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
