Weighed anchor in Taihoae Bay at noon today (31MAY) and are now sailing towards Fakarava in the Tuammotu Archipelago. Total  distance is about 550 nm, so we hope to take about 5 days to get there. Beautiful sailing currently, beam...broad reaching under starry  skies and an almost full moon. Had a very nice couple of days in Taihoae together with Topze.  All is well aboard stay tuned...
