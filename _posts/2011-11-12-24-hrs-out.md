Crossed the Gulf Stream today, motorsailing in light winds... a few eddies to the east of the stream which we'll hopefully get around...  temperatures have picked up again... all is well aboard, Nicky now sleeps in the cockpit (with life jacket and tether), so he can see the  stars and the moon... stay tuned
