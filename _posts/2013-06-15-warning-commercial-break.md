Before we left New Zealand we finally managed to get Nana's latest book, <em>Lesson Plans To Go: Hands-on Learning for Active and Home Schooling Families</em>, onto "the shelf" at Amazon.com in paperback and kindle versions. The book contains ten units with fun educational activities for children ages 4-12 that families can use at home or on the road. If you have some land-lubbing friends who might be interested in enriching their vacation with some learning opportuniites for their kids please pass on this link to them: <a href="http://www.lessonplanstogo.info">www.lessonplanstogo.info</a>.
Or - even better - include the link above in one of your own blog posts which would help tremendously with improving its search rank in google ;-)
