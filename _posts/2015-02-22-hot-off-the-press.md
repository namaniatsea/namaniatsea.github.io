Having recently returned from sailing across the Pacific Ocean in our thirty-five foot sloop, we hear the same question all the time: So, what is it like?

We still struggle to answer in brief layman's terms, because words like "nice" and "great" hardly do justice to the world's largest body of water or the (so far) biggest adventure of our lives. We took a different tack and provided a more thorough answer in 100,000 words (give or take). That answer is in *[Pacific Crossing Notes](http://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Crossing-Notes-Sailors-Coconut-ebook/dp/B00RAD0W30)* which is now available at Amazon. In the book, we aim to provide coverage that's broad enough to be useful while detailed enough to remain practical. And while no single volume can claim to be fully comprehensive, this book does compile a vast body of information. Along with information on clearing-in procedures, availability of supplies, and top anchorages and sights, the book covers Panama, the Galapagos Islands, Marquesas, Tuamotus, Society Islands, Cook Islands, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. Separate sections describe a trip down the US East Coast, the Panama Canal, New Zealand, and Australia (including tips on selling a boat there for a one-way trip). The equivalent of a 380 page print book for less than the price of a couple of cold beers in the tropics -- or a single issue of a sailing magazine ;-)
