Just after sunset, when we were getting ready to take in the lure we had been trawling all afternoon, we caught a nice size yellow fin tuna.  Sashimi tonight and tuna steak tomorrow - no complaints in the food department on Namani ;-) Otherwise a relaxed day, part sailing, part motoring to get through the center of a high that strecthes down to almost 30deg south. A clear  starry night outside with a sliver of a waxing moon that's about to set. Still going through fields of plumice every few hours. Apparently these  coee from an underwater volcano eruption in the Kermadec Islands. The biggest pieces we've been seeing are about tennis ball size.  Other boats further south report pumpkin size pieces that have turned into to little biotopes, complete with crabs, mussels and other marine  life. We keep checking the cooling water intake for our engine, but so far so good. Early this morning our GPS odometer clocked over the 9999nm mark back to 0. Adding about 3000nm from the Galapagos to the  Marquesas where we didn't have the GPS on, that makes 13000nm (and counting) since we put Namani back in the water last August  All is well aboard, stay tuned...
