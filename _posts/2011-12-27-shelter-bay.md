Arrived in Shelter Bay (across from Colon at the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal) today, after a nice sail from Portobelo and after weaving our way through the cargo ships anchored off the Canal entrance.

Markus will have dry-run through the Canal tomorrow and Thursday as a line handler on AstartÃ©. We still plan on going through during the first half of January.   Very nice to be here now - makes the Canal transit feel very real and imminent... stay tuned...
