Friday (06APR) turned out to be a very nice sailing day - and it still is now, a few minutes past midnight under a full moon and a few  scattered clouds. While we had to motor through much of last night (Thursday into Friday), the wind picked up around 9am local time this  morning, and we had some very nice sailing, close reaching under sunny skies over a gentle swell (plus some help from the current). Sun  glasses out for the first time since leaving Cristobal! The wind was out of SSE, but still a bit too light for broad reaching on a direct course to  the Marquesas. Hence we continue to go SSW..SW, hoping that the wind will pick up a bit and we finally can start to run with it. All is well  aboard, stay tuned...
