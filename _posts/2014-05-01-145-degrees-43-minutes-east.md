Back in August 2007 Namani was at her eastern most point in the Greek Aegean at about 25 degrees East.  Now, at the end of our trip on Namani we're at our western most point, about 10nm north of Cairns at 145 degrees 43 minutes East. So Namani has made it almost exactly 2/3 around the globe (if measured by meridians crossed westwards, and not counting a few Atlantic crossings under Heinz, her previous owner).

We arrived here at Namani's new home - the Yorkey's Knob Boat Club north of Cairns - yesterday morning after a nice overnight sail.  Janet, Namani's new owner, and Bill came to visit yesterday afternoon; it's nice to see Namani going into good hands :-).  We'll do some more 'hand over sailing' over the weekend and then will have a few more days before we fly out of Cairns next Thursday...
