After our <a href="http://www.sailblogs.com/member/namaniatsea/?xjMsgID=311837">TC Ita episode in Pacific Creek</a>, we stopped at Keppel Bay Marina in Rosslyn Bay for two nights to re-provision, do laundry, and get water and fuel. Then we were off again on 18APR, for an overnight sail to Scawfell Island in the Southern Cumberlands (the same island group that the Whitsundays belong to). From there we continued in day hops, first to Shaw Island, and then onto to Sawmill Bay on the the west side of Whitsunday Island, where we arrived last Tuesday (22APR; it's Saturday today). The last few days we've spent in different bays around the Whitsundays, feeling reminded of a charter vacation we had here in 2005 (remember that, Jez?)

Now we plan to weigh anchor here early tomorrow morning to leave at first light for Palm Island, about 170nm NW of us. We plan for a night or two there before embarking on the truly last leg of our journey - 120nm to Cairns.  We've been enjoying this little delivery trip up the Australian East coast.  If the forecast is right we should have good wind for the home stretch - let's see how that pans out.
