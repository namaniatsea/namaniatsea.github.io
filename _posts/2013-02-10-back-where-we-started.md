After almost two months we're now (Sunday, 10FEB) back in Opua in the the Bay of Islands. After leaving Oneroa Bay off Waheke on Wednesday, we stopped in Bon Accord Bay (Kawau Island at the northern end of the Hauraki Gulf), and then had two longish sailing days, first to Whangarei and then to Whangamumu (old whaling station), before turning the corner around Cape Brett and into the Bay of Islands on Saturday afternoon. We had a nice night at anchor off Urupukapuka Island here in the Bay (see picture above) and then came back into Opua Marina this afternoon. We plan to be here for three days to get a new bimini fitted and knock a few more odd jobs off Namani's to-do list (changing engine mounts, another fix to the windlass motor, plus some smaller stuff).

We had a nice surprise this afternoon when he heard Mel from the boat Samba call out "Namani" when we came into the marina today. We enjoyed a nice evening with them and are now ready for some boat work again ;-)
