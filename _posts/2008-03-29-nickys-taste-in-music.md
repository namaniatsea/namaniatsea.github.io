To his papa's delight and his mom's dismay Nicky has started to express very specific music preferences aboard Namani.  He likes music  with a very pronounced drum and bass line to which he will either dance or drum along using one or more of his Lego containers (=3D  oversized Tupperwares).  His most frequent request is "Time" by Pink Floyd (live version from "Pulse" album). The complete "Nicky's  Favorites" playlist on our MP3 player includes also: Spin Doctors: Jimmy Olsen's Blues, Little Miss, Two Princes Crowded House: Locked out Counting Crows: Hard Candy, Mr. Jones Beautiful South: Perfect 10 David Gray: Dead in the Water Paul McCartney: Off the Ground U2: Mysterious Ways Manfed Mann's Earth Band: Mighty Quinn (for "Live at Budapest" album)

Not bad taste for a 4 1/2 year-old (at least according to his papa)!

We have been anchored off Great Bird Island which is part of a bigger reef system just north of Antigua (see picture above) for three nights - very beautiful and  almost deserted (on our first night here we were the only boat in the anchorage).  Our extended stay here is due to another "north swell  event" (fall out from a depression and associated frontal system moving off the east coast of North America a few days ago) which is  forecast to subside tomorrow.  That's when we plan to leave for Barbuda an then on to St. Kitts.  Puerto Rico is not that far anymore and  the planning and mental preparation for the longer passages from Puerto Rico to Bermuda and Bermuda to Maine has now begun in  earnest.  Something to keep the mind focused...
