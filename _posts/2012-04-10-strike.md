Caught our first Dorado on this trip today (Mon, 09APR)! Sushi snack followed by a very tasty dinner... Sailing is very different now  compared to the first few days of the passage. Then - while sailing clause hauled/close reaching - it seemed we were constantly taking  reeefs in out of sails, trimmin, tacking, ... and watches were very busy. Now the wind has settled (we hope) on/just abaft the beam and  things have become more relaxed. We put the Parasailor up this morning and had it fly all day, steered by the wind vane (with some brief  help from hand steering during a squall). Made for a comfortable ride all day. Took it down again in the evening and swapped it for the  genoa for the night. That's it. Hence, there is now more time for play, school - and fishing. Nana is even close to finishing "Path between  the Seas" (500 pg book on the history of and behind the Panama Canal - fascinating reading). There will porbably be a few less  comfortable days along the way, but right now it's very enjoyable. Now (04:30am local time on Tuesday morning) we have about 2400nm  to go until the Marquesas - should be another three weeks, give or take. All is well aboard. Stay tuned...
