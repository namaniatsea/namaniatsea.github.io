After almost a week in Pittwater we splurged on a new head for Namani. Something we originally wanted to do in 2011 before we left Maine, but that never quite made it to the top of the projects list... We installed it yesterday and we're still admiring the shiny white thing. Also felt kind of funny zipping across the bay with a toilet in the dinghy...

We've arrived in Pittwater from Port Stephens last Saturday (07DEC), just in time for a visit from Tina and Philipp who came up from Sydney on Sunday. We had a very nice sailing day with lots of catching up. They even brought us some 'Lebkuchen' (the traditional German Christmas time  ginger bread) - so now we have a reminder that it is indeed the festive season - still a bit unusual for us northern hemisphere creatures with sun and beaches all around...

In addition to the boat projects (toilet et al) we're also making progress on the picture front: We've put up a new album with a selection from our photos from Fiji. They can be found under <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/10AFiji?authuser=0&feat=directlink">this link</a>.

Vanautu and New Caledonia to follow soon...
