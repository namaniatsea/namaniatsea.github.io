Skies did ineed clear during the second part of last night and we've had beautiful sailing since then. Wind at 12-15kn from just abaft the  beam, swell less confused now, mostly out of the SE. Had the Parasailor up today and it did it's trick again and significantly reduced the  rolling motion of the boat (now back under genoa for the night). Trolled fishing lines for the first time today, no success yet though. Had  about 10 flying fish on deck this morning (must have landed unexpectedly when trying to escape from some bigger fish). Another one  landed in the bathroom sink tonight (came in through the bathroom hatch). Now we need some more on the deck to have bait for  tomorrow... About 2550nm to go the Marquesas. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
