Slipped our lines in Port Antonio at 11:30 this morning and are now about 20 nm south of Jamaica's south eastern corner. Beautiful sailing  conditions, running downwind in 15kn of wind under a twistle-rigged genoa and clear starry skies. Our friend Bill arrived in Jamaica  yesterday and joins us for this leg to Panama - we're very happy to have him aboard!  We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Jamaica and  think Port Antonio must be among the most under-rated cruising destinations in the Caribbean. Very friendly people in a beautiful setting.

All is well aboard - stay tuned....
