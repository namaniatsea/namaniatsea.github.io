After a windy night at anchor we had a very nice sail today, broad reaching in 20kn N winds across the Albermarle Sound and down the  first part of the Aligator River (went for a brief dip despite the threatening name ;-). Watching development of the long-term weather outlook  with great suspense, still hoping for a 05/06NOV departure from Beaufort towards the Caribbean.... stay tuned...
