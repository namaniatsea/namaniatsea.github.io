We slipped our mooring at the 79th St Boat Basin at noon on Wednesday,  sailed out under the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and "turned right" towards Cape May where we arrived Thursday afternoon. After a very bumpy ride out of New York with wind against tide things settled down a bit once we were south of Sandy Hook. We had a nice close hauled sail through the night but then got drenched in a series of showers and thunderstorms that accompanied a passing cold front on Thursday morning. In any case, we are now happily anchored in Cape May Harbor where it seems we now got a second lease on summer.  Feels like another little milestone (we're now below 39°N!). We'll stay here for a few days before heading up the Delaware Bay into the Chesapeake.

The video below was taken just before night fall on Wednesday after we had left New York. We have also added some pictures to the Photo Gallery (see link to right) in the "Maine Shakedown Cruise" album and a new "US East Coast Southbound" album.
