Hello from underway again, this time about 15 nm SE of Great Abaco Island in the NW Bahamas at 10 pm local time ... the dreaded cold  front passed us this morning between 4 and 5 am after a train of scattered thunder storms had passed just north of us... after the wind  suddenly clocked about 40 degrees into the NNW all of the sudden the air became cool and dry - we're almost back in temperate  latitudes... Bill makes fun of us now for feeling cold in airs of about 25 deg Celsius - we'll get used to it eventually...

Originally, we had planned on a short stop in the Abaco Islands but current wind and the weather forecast may have us continue straight  on towards West Palm Beach in Florida in order to get Bill back to the mainland in time... stay tuned for further updates

PS: If anyone has access to news for the Bahamas: we're seeing the glow of a big fire somewhere on the east coast of Great Abaco Island  (we can smell it too, about 20 nm downwind) - any information what this is?
