Dropped the hook off Porvenir in Panama's San Blas Islands at 08:00 local time this morning.. Had a really beautiful sail from Jamaica to here. Now getting ready to go ashore to clear in with Customs and Immigration and find out about flight options for Bill who needs to return  to the US. More to follow later...

Picture above shows enjoying a cold drink after arrival with trying to organize his transport back to the US.
