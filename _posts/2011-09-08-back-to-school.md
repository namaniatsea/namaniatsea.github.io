Yesterday (Wed, 07SEP), Nicky's school year has started in earnest. Two days of weather imposed down-time in Castine provide a good opportunity to start settling into a school routine on board. After German and English writing yesterday, there was more German (picture above), Math and English writing today. We augmented the "normal school hours" by some fun reading (e.g. the Magic Treehouse series with books on the Pilgrims and Thanksgiving). Up here in Maine it's also very easy to tie in some colonial history throughout the day.  Nicky has also enjoyed our afternoon outings to the very welcoming Castine Public Library. It's easy to forget what a treasure these public libraries are.
