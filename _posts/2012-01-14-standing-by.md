We left Shelter Bay at 1400 today and are now anchored in the "Flats". Our Advisor arrival ETA has been confirmed for 1730 local time so  we expect to arrive at Gatun Locks around 1900 local time. The webcam URL for the lock is  http://www.pancanal.com/eng/photo/camera-java.html. If you do see us going through the lock please take a screen shot ;-)
