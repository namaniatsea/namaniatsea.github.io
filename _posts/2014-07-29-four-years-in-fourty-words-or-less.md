While migrating our blog from Sailblogs to this address we had to do some data wrangling with the blog texts, comments, etc., and we wondered if we could plot word frequencies in some meaningful way. [wordle.net](http://wordle.net) allows you to do just that: generate word clouds from either plaint text or "word:count" pairs and print them in full color. The picture above shows the 40 or so most frequent words in our blog posts during our four years of living aboard Namani (not counting stop-words like "the", "I", ...). Looks we didn't have much to complain about ;-)
