We moved the content from [Nicky's Page](/nicky-page) to this site  (see box "Nicky's Page" to the rigtht - or below if you're reading this on a very small screen). It includes a selection of school reports that Nicky worked on while living on Namani. The latest addition is a movie about "Life on a Boat" which Nicky compiled and edited while we were in Australia. You can watch his final cut on [his page](/nicky-page/life-boat) or [directly on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/103625292). Enjoy!
