Namani is back on the water and we're finally spending our first night at anchor. After a relaxing sail to Eagle Island (former home of Admiral Peary, the Polar explorer) we spent the night in the Gosslings, a beautiful anchorage in the center of Casco Bay. Nicky enjoys the late afternoon sun in the picture above before going for a swim in the (nearly polar-cold) waters.
