On our way back from the South Island, we spent a fun night with our friends from Sea Bright in Devonport and a morning at the Auckland museum to wrap up Nickyâs school unit on Art and Culture. It is great to have this much time in NZ to see our friends a lot more often than we would be able to do from Europe! Then we headed back to the airport to pick up Nanaâs Mom who flew all the way from New York for a week long visit. It was short but we packed a lot in, from a hike up the extinct volcano on Rangitoto island to the Auckland zoo to catch a glimpse of a kiwi (mostly they hid, but Markus saw two!) and finally up to the Bay of Islands where we went out on Namani to anchor off the islands for a few nights. It was great to be able to host her out on the water before seeing her off at the airport for the long flight home. Hopefully, her next visit can be longer! She is an expert in deliveries, bringing everything from books to charts and the most important thing of all - brownie mix - to us on Namani, not to mention a load of great birthday gifts for Nicky from Paul and Emily. (For the record, there is brownie mix in this country but it is expensive!) Thanks Bafia!
