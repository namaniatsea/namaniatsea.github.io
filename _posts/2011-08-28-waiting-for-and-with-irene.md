Now back on Peaks Island  awaiting the passage of what is now Tropical Storm Irene, together with Nana's sister Irene, their mother and Nicky's cousin Pearl. The picture above was taken on Peaks Island's back shore at low tide, about 4 hours before the forecasted closest point of approach of Irene.
