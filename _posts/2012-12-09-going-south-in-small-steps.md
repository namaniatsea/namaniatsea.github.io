The North Island is under a high pressure ridge with almost no gradient wind. There was a bit of a sea breeze picking up around 11am this  morning. So we weighed anchor and had a beautiful afternoon, sailing out of the Bay of Islands passed Cape Brett and down to  Whangamumu Harbour under sunny blue skies (all of 20nm! ;-). There is no harbour down here but remnants of an old whaling station and  a very beautfiful bay. Braved the icy NZ waters for a quick swim this afternoon (why did leave the tropics again?). Now we hope for a bit of  wind to set in so we can actually sail to Great Barrier Island by Wednesday.
