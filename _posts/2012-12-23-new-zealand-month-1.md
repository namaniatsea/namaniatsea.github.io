It's been exactly a month since we arrived at at the Q dock in Opua. After a week at the dock and another at anchor in Opua we finally started moving again on 09DEC and have since criss-crossed the greater Hauraki Gulf (the pink line on the image above is Namani's track over the past two weeks). We've had some beautiful sailing (with quite a bit of windward work as you can tell from the odd looking tracks above), enjoyed some very nice anchorages, and above all some good company with Seabright, Saltbreaker., and a surprise encounter with Victoria. Realizing that Alex from Saltbreaker has a graduate degree in Computational Mathematics and that his brother Nick worked in acoustics prior to going sailing was a weird but enjoyable flashback to my university days... and a fun evening of "geeking out". Now we'll sign off over the holidays. Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone!
