Anyway, first I made the model of Namani with a really good modeller called Blender 2.6. This took about a week. Then I started animating it in Blender. The first animation I made was a simple rotating view of the boat (2 seconds long), and then I started making more and more complicated animations until I made the tacking animation (15 seconds, see below). Then me and my dad mixed a bunch of the animations together (solid, wireframe, etc.) and added stuff like the credits and the music. That's about it.
