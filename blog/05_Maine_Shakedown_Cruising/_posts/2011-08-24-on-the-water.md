We were finally able to take Namani for a first test sail down to Peaks Island today. Some gusty winds around a passing cold front but everything seems to work fine. Now the big question is what hurricane Irene will be doing as current forecasts have her track right through New England. Originally we thought to hunker down in some safe bay but after the latest forecast we'll probably have Namani hauled out again before Irene's arrival on Sunday.
