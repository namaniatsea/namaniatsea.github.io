On the passage from New Zealand to Fiji we took some video clips along the way. Nicky cut and edited theses into a 4:40 min movie about the passage. You can watch it on [Nicky's Page]({% link nicky_page/_posts/2013-07-13-new-zealand-to-fiji.md %}).

We' ve also added a few pictures to our [recent posts below from the Lau Group]({% link blog/11_New_Zealand_to_Australia/_posts/2013-07-12-sailing-to-long-island.md %}) - enjoy!
