We're about 12nm away from tne entrance to the Canal de Hanvannah, the SE entry into the lagoon of New Caledonia. After leaving Port  Vila in Vanuatu on Tuesday afternoon our original plan was to stop at Ile Mare in the Loyalty Islands east of New Cal.'s main island  However, when we got there around mid day yesterday (Thu), a wind shift expected from a weak passing front had yet to materralize and  none of the anchorages was tenable in a still northerly wind. Hence we raised the sails again to continue the 60nm to New Caledonia's  main island. We have Daniel from Radiance with us on this passage which makes for an easy watch schedule and is a nice social break  from our usual routine. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
