Quick update from the "other" side of the Corinth Channel.  After 3 very nice days in the Gulf of Corinth with Catherine and Chris (including a trip to Delphi) we stayed a night in Corinth and then went through the channel on Sunday (pictures to follow - impressive sight).  Having reached the western exit we then sailed on to Aigina which was quite a wet slug against wind and waves.  We ended up with a bilge full of seawater because the drainage from our anchor locker was clogged and all the water we were getting over the bow ended up flooding part of our provisions... But that's behind us and fixed now.
We spent 2 nights here and will head for the Southwest Aegean early tomorrow morning.  More detailed update to follow - stay tuned...
