After a beautiful Gulf Stream crossing last night (up to 9+ kn in light winds on very settled seas) we arrived in Harbor Town Marina, Fort  Pierce, Florida today.  Bill will head back home to D.C. tomorrow and we'll spend a quick visit to Nicky's cousin Pearl across the Floriday  peninsula.  We had some of the nicest sailing since starting this trip between the Turks & Caicos and here (despite some  becalmed/motoring periods) and very much enjoyed sailing with Bill.  Now we have to get an engine repair done before we head further up  the coast - a story for another post ... stay tuned...
