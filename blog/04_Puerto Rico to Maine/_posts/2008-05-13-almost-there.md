3 am and about 100 nm to go to Spanish Cay in the Abacos (NW Bahamas), where we plan to make a (hopefully brief) pit stop to top-up  diesel... the cold front seems to pass through just north of us and we're having very nice sailing conditions, close reaching under starry  skies... all is well aboard - stay tuned for further updates
