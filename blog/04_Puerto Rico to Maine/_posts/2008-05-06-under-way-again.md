Left Puerto Rico yesterday afternoon and enjoyed a good afternoon and night of sailing on a beam/broad reach between 6 and 7 kn. Now  the wind has died and we are motoring.  Bill joined us on Saturday in Puerto Rico and before leaving the marina on Sunday we enjoyed a  very nice evening trip to a Lagoon with lots of bio-luminescence.  Quite an awesome sight to swim in there.  Now we're hoping for the wind to pick again. Current position is 19-57.7N 067-43.7W,  all is well aboard - stay tuned...
