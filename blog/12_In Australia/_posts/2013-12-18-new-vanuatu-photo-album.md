Some more progress on the picture front: We've put up a selection of photos from our month in Vanuatu under <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107642355341658270464/10BVanuatu?authuser=0&feat=directlink" title="">this link</a>.

We've enjoyed our almost two weeks here in Pittwater (named after the same William Pitt, The Elder, that Pittsburgh, PA got its name from - a small world even back then) and Broken Bay and will leave for Sydney tomorrow.
