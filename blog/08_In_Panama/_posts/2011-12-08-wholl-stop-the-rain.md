Some real tropical downpours in our anchorage today, as squalls associated with a tropical wave just NE of here move through.  A very welcome replenishment of our fresh water supply after collecting more than 20 gallons in half an hour and enough to spare to do some laundry. Also a chance to catch up on schoolwork and some house-keeping. Things should get drier again by Sunday.
