Anchored off Porvenir now (8pm local time). Checked out with the harbor master here to get our "Zarpe", the exit document we need to  check into our next port of call. Planning to go to Portobello tomorrow (about 55nm), anchor there over the holidays, and then continue to  Colon. The squalls and rain we had the last two weeks are finally forecast to move off to the west but starting Wedneday seas are forecast  to become bigger (>10ft NE swell from strong tradewinds in the Eastern and Central Caribbean). Hence we want to get out of their way  tomorrow. Talked on the VHF to a family from Herrsching this morning (practically neighbours to our Bavarian hometown) and are anchored  next to Polish boat with very nice crew tonight. A small world again...  It's been really wonderful in the San Blas (despite the unusual squally  weather) and we could easily spend another month here. Nevertheless glad we got a good taste of it and are a little eager to move on as  well.
