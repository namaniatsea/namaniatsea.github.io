... just noticed that the previous post was truncated at the end. What we meant to say was: After all this time at a town mooring in Annapolis it feels as if we have to get our sea legs back again. We promptly ran aground on our way to the Hudson Creek anchorage in a spot where the chart shows plenty of water (see picture above; soundings in feet - we draw six of them). Seems as if there is not only the concept of true and apparent wind, but also something like "true and apparent depth"... Luckily it's all soft sand and mud around here, so we were able to wiggle Namani out of there and then followed a very kind boat from Buckport, ME, who - with a five foot draft - offered to serve as our depth scout into the channel.
