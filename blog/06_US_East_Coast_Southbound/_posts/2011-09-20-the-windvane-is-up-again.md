Almost forgot to mention: The new Hydrovane seems to proof a worthy successor to our old Windpilot self-steering. Have used it on a close reach/close hauled towards Gloucester and down-wind and broad reaching towards Cuttyhunk and Newport. Very satisfied so far. Now we have to see how it copes with bigger seas (where the Windpilot struggled)...
