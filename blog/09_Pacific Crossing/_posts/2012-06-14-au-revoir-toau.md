We had five wonderful days in Anse Amyot on Toau, enjoying the hospitality of Valentine and Gaston, the company of the other boats in  the anchorage and the shear beauty of the location - plus a dinner for the 60 people on the Crusing World Adventure Charter fleet who  visited one night (something for another post...). We slipped our mooring there at 1230h local time yesterday (13JUN) and are now about  half-way to Tahiti, where we hope to arrive around mid-day tomorrow. We then have two days to "park" the boat, before Nicky and  Markus will fly back to Germany for visit to Nicky's Opa on 17JUN.

Wind is good (on the beam), seas a bit confused but not too big - all is well aboard, stay tuned...
