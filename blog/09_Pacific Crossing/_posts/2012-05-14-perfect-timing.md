As things turned out, we originally arrived on Hiva Oa on 30APR at the same time that Jomique's flight from Nuku Hiva was making its approach onto the island. Jomique was taking pictures out of the plane's window and happened to catch Tahauku Bay on film precisely at the time that we had just dropped bow and stern anchors here (the red arrow in the picture above points to Namani).
