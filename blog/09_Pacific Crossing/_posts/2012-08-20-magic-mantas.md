Moved to the NE corner of Bora Bora yesterday afternoon as there was said to be a great snorkeling spot to see some very big manta rays.  We went with Samba and E Capoe to see the mantas this morning and they were indeed BIG... very beautiful.

Nicky had Tosca from Topaze and Valerie from E Capoe over for a sleep over last night which was very nice as well... pancake breakfast in  the morning, just before going off to snorkel - not bad for a Monday morning... Will move to the main town on the west side today to clear out of French Polynesia and to get the last provisioning done. Weather permitting, we will then leave for Maupiti on Wednesday. Stay  tuned...
