About 45nm to go to Suwarrow (Thursday, 22:00 local time / Friday 08:00 utc). Wind has finally started to decrease this afternoon. Seas  have started to go down as well and, more importantly, have become more regular. A nice change from the jerky-rolling motion of the last  few days (we had some things flyi through the cabin that up to then had happily sat in their spot since we left Maine last summer....)..

Should be making landfall at daybreak tomorrow, All is well aboard stay tuned...
