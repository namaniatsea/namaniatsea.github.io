Forgot to mention in yesterday's post: We finally switched Namani's "ship's time" back another hour yesterday afternoon. We're now 9  hours "behind" utc. We checked the Nautical Almanac and it seems the only place we currently share this time zone with are Alaska's  Aleutian Islands west of 169°30'W during the current daylight savings time there (the Aleutians east of 169°30'W are apparently in a  different time zone, currently only 8 hours behind utc). So: Greetings from us to the Western Aleutians!

Another nice and relaxed sailing day today. If we can continue ro average at least 4kn we should be reaching Hiva Oa around mid-day on  Monday.. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
