Left Maupiti at 14:30h local time this afternoon, after some boat work, quick snorkeling excursion. and a look at the pass from the dinghy.  Pass turned out to be not a problem. Seas are a bit confused, making for a rolly ride, but wavelength is forecast to increase as the wind  lessens tomorrow (Sun). About 660nm to Suwarrow. All is well aboard, stay tuned....
