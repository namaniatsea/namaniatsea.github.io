Namani is (almost) ready to be relaunched this morning, just a few touches of antifouling left to apply. To celebrate the end of "hard time" we had a dinner out yesterday with four other families at the "Snack Mimosa" just outside the boat yard. When showing up with 10 adults and 8 kids we first found the restaurant closed. But then Mimosa, the woman owner, kindly agreed to open for us and we had a wonderful meal with what she had left in the kitchen.

On a separate note: we put together a little video from Nicky's first scuba dive on Moorea. Enjoy!
