We raised Antigua (or a land mass that we hope to be Antigua) at 0815 local this morning and will have English Harbour abeam in one hour  with an ETA at Jolly Harbour, our destination here, at 1500 local today.  Another good 24 hr run with 147 nm on the log finally saved us and  we hope to make happy hour tonight!
