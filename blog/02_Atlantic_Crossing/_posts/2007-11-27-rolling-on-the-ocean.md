Hello from the Atlantic where we have been heading west since last Wednesday (21NOV), when the tradewinds finally settled in again.  After 24 hours of very confused seas we're now in a pattern of good sailing days with squally nights.  Continued rolling in cross swells  makes life aboard a bit strenuous as you cannot put down anything e.g. for cooking without it flying off some surface in the next big wave  and you permanently have to wedge yourself somewhere below decks while brushing teeth, washing dishes etc.  But we are getting used  to it and have enjoyed some very fine sailing days under twin headsails which have proofed a very favorable sail configuration for this type  of downwind sailing.  About 1650 nm to go - All is well aboard, stay tuned for further updates...

PS: we have caught some fish (dorado, very tasty) since our last post and hope for some renewed fishing luck today or tomorrow to freshen  up the meal plan...
