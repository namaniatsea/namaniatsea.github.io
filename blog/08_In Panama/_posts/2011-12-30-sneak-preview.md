Got a sneak preview of the Canal transit over the past two days on <a href="http://www.sailastarte.com">AstartÃ©</a> with Barbara and Michael, and Sue and Lenny from Windancer. A very interesting and fun experience, also very helpful to get a better idea of what to expect for our own transit. Namani was officially measured on Thursday and our transit date has now been set for 14JAN. We have enough boat projects lined up to keep us busy until then...
