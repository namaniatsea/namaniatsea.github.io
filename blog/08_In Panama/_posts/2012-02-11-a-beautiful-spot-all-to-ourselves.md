Moved 15 nm south today to Isla Viveros, where we have a beautiful anchorage under starry skies all to ourselves. Shoreline is rocky and  wooded - feels a bit like Maine with a tropical climate. Boat work continues: Papi fixing the head, Mami scrubbing growth off the bottom  and Nicky supervising it all ;-)
