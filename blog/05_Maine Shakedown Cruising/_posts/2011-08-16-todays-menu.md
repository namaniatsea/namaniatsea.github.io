A quick look to Namani's stove reveals that there is still some more boat work on the menu... getting close though - hope to complete Hydrovane installation tomorrow and new Radar on Thursday which then leaves just a few odd jobs  - we've said that before though... "nothing ever is easy when working on boats" as they say around the yard. In the meantime we did have the mast stepped and got our sails back today (already had them once last week but stack pack needed some re-work). Stay tuned...
