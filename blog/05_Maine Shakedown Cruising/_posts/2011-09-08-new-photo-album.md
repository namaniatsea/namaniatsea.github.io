Added a new photo album "Maine Shakedown Cruise" (see photo gallery link on the right). The picture above shows Nicky and Papa in North Haven, using the grocery store's wifi to check the weather forecast.

If you like moving pictures: Here's a short clip of Nana sailing around Cape Small, leaving Casco Bay behind us at last (we'll be very happy to come back though).
