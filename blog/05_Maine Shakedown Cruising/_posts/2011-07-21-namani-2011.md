We're getting there, slowly but surely... After three years on the hard at Yankee Marina in Yarmouth, ME, Namani is now getting tantalizingly close to being launched again. The hull is now in good shape (with "Namani 2011" unfortunately being covered again by Awlgrip "Deep Blue" anti-fouling paint...) and the yard is close to completing some extensive core restoration of the deck. There are plenty of jobs left on the to-do list, but we hope to have her back in the water next Monday (25JUL) and then to be ready to sail up to Canada the week thereafter. We know that's the wrong way for going to Panama but as a German flagged boat we'll need to renew our crusing permit for US waters, for which we'll have to spent at least 15 days abroad. So finally we'll be getting a taste of those 6m tides in the Bay of Fundy... In any case, time to re-activate this blog again for things to ccome.  Stay tuned...
