Tahiti came in sight at dawn this morning. Now (0630) local timethe rising sun starts to paints the mountain peaks (max &#61; 2200m) in a  beautiful orange-pink. We hope to pass Point Venus (where Captain Cook observed the Transit of Venus in 1769) between 0900 and  1000 and then reach the harbour by mid-day. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
