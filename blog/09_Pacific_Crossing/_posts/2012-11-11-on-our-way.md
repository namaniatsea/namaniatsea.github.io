Weighed anchor at 1430 local time this afternoon (11NOV) and left the anchorage at Big Mama's for Minerva Reef. There is nothing bad  on the radar weatherwise, so we decided to make our way to Minerva while we still have some decent wind for the next 36hrs in the  forecast. If the wind doesn't totally die on us we should be able to get there by Wednesday morning. By then we should also know how  quickly we can continue south to NZ, All is well aboard, stay tuned...
