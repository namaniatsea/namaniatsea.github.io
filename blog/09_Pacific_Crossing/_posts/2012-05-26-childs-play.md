Left Ua Pou early this morning (Friday), together with Topze and Merilelu, to sail 30nm to the north for Nuku Hiva. What looked like  something between a close and a beam reach on the forecast turned out to be a beat to windward. Nice conditions and a nice sail  though. Here in Hanga Haa (one "finger" in the larger "Baie du Contrôleur" on the southeastern end of Nulu Hiva) we found E Capoe and  Samba again. So together with Nicky, and Toasca and Gabrielle from Topaze we now have eight kids between 5 and 11 years in the  anchorage here and they all convened on Samba this afternoon (thanks Peter and Mel...). An interesting language mix as well. No  common language that all of them share, but with some of them being bi-lingual (English/French, German/French, German/English) there's  always a workable "translation relay" (not that they really need it anyway...).



Will go explore some Tikis tomorrow, replenish our water supplies and then move on again Sunday morning - att least according to the  current plan... stay tuned...
