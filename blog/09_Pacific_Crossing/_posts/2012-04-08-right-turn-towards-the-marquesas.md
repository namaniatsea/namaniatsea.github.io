The wind did pick up a bit and has steadied once we reached about 6 deg S, so we could finally make that "right turn" and are now  sailing more or less directly towards the Marquesas. Skies are still mostly overcast but we hope this will break up as we go further WSW.  Nicky built a very cool sailboat out of Lego over the past two days - a cutter rigged sloop, complete with functioning roller reefing foresail,  winches and all. Now the challenge is to keep it in one piece while the boat rolls with the waves ... ;-) All is well aboard, stay tuned...
