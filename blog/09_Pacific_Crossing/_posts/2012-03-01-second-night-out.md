..again under stary clear skies. Had a nice relaxed sailing day with good progress and some help from the current. The Pilot Charts for  March show a large  circular clockwise setting current in the basin formed by Panama and Columbia, and it seems we're riding the south  setting portion of it (by luck rather than by design...). 671 nm to go to the Galapgos. All is well aboard, stay tuned...

PS: Picture above shows Markus earlier today, trying to "unfreeze" the ends of our spinnaker pole.
