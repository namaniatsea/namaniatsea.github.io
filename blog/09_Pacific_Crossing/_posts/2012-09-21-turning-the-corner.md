The wind filled back in today and after some good progress it looks like we will make landfall in Niue tomorrow (Friday). Until this afternoon  we had sailed about 10&#176; south of the rhumb line to build some buffer in case the wind would start to head us. At 2pm this afternoon we  "turned the corner" and started spending that southing credit by sailing a more westerly course (255&#176;T vs 220&#176;T). Victoria is about half a  day behind us, followed by Aspasia another 24 hrs behind. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
