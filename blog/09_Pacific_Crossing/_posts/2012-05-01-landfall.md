Cliffs at the eastern end of Hiva Oa became visible ahead of us at dawn today (1450Z, 0550 ship's time), only seconds after our last star fix put us within 3 nm of our GPS position. Motane, a little island south of Hiva Oa is visible to port. Will still take us about 3 hrs to actually reach the eastern end of Hiva Oa and  another 4 hrs to reach Atuona and the anchorage from there. Were able to sail again and shut the engine off at 0500 ship's time but will  probably lose the ENE wind once we get into the lee of Hiva Oa. Stay tuned... 

UPDATE: Are now safely anchored off Hiva Oa. Had a lovely dinner with Barbara and Michael on AstartÃ© and already met Jomique on a quick grocery shopping expedition in town (he arrived by plane today). More to follow after a good night's sleep...
