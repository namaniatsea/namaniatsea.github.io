Had a little Halloween party today among the kids in the anchorage. Here's Nicky's report:

 Halloween at Nomuka was very fun. I was dressed up as tropical Santa Claus. Niclas and Hannes (from the boat Victoria) were little  pirates. Piper (from Radiance) was a blue mermaid, and Breeza (from Moonwalker) was a pink fairy. We got tasty popcorn, sugary cookies,  colorful candy, and on Moonwalker we had delicious Brazilian chocolate pudding. Niclas and I each took one oar of the blue dinghy to  paddle all the kids quickly from boat to boat. We got some brownie from Namani which I immediately ate and I also gobbled some popcorn  from Victoria. At each boat, Niclas and I sang ÂDas Hotte PferdÂ loudly. The candy looks really tasty and we had a lot of fun!
