This area's first tropical low  of the season passed just to the south of us this afternoon, making us feel glad that we did move inside the  harbor here in Tongatapu on Monday. While we didn't see much above 30kn in here, boats out the anchorage reported a peak of 76kn  when the wind suddenly shifted from N to SW in thundery squall behind the low's center (probably doesn't sound like much to the people  who've just been hit by Sandy on the US East Coast though...). Luckily, everyone out there seems to be OK and the barometer is now  slowly on the rise. We'll probably stay in here until Friday morning, when the wind is forecast to turn back to the SE and hence would no  longer blow across the long open tech to the NW...W of the anchorage. We're still hoping for a departure date end of this week or early  next week - fingers crossed. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
