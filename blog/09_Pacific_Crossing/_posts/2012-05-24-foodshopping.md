Nana and Caroline from Topaze went ashore this afternoon to get some fresh fruit and vegetables. As it turns out, the little store in  Hakehetau is not the place to go to, but Fatima's house, a bit up into the mountains. Caroline had talked to her the day before on the  waterfront and had been told to come to her house this afternoon. Want pamplemouse (the soccer ball sized grapefruit that we've become  so addicted to)? No poblem - she just steps off the back porch and picks some from a tree. Fresh bread? She's just baked a few loafs and  parts with one each for Namani and Topaze. Papaya and cabbage go in a similar fashion. The pricing is "flexible" - you can trade with  some small cosmetics items for her daughter. Alternatively, Nana and her agree on the equivalent of US$10 for as much as Nana can  carry...



Earlier today we had a nice hike to a beautiful waterfall. followed by a BBQ lunch at Nadja and Atai's house in the village (delicious again,  no frigat bird this time...). We'll leave for Nuku Hiva early tomorrow (Fridays) morning, before the wind turns NE on Saturday.
