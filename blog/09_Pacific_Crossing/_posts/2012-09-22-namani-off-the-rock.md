Picked up a mooring here at Niue at 1400 local time today (Friday), exactly 96 hours after we weighed anchor at Suwarrow on Monday.  Sailed a total of 562 nm, making this one of our fastest passages (5.9kn average). The wind stayed with us all the way and we could sail right up to the mooring field. Only a few boats here (including Gudrun V, Black Dog and Saltbreaker). We'll go ashore tomorrow morning to  clear in and get a first taste of the island they call "The Rock". All is well aboard, stay tuned...
