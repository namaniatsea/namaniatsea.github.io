Nicky just completed a two-week project of developing a 3D-model of Namani and animating it into a short video clip.  Working from photos and some blueprint drawings, he used an Open Source software called '<a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a>' to develop and animate the model.

Check out [Nicky's page]({% link nicky_page/_posts/2014-02-26-namani-goes-3d.md %}) to watch the 30 second long animated video clip.
