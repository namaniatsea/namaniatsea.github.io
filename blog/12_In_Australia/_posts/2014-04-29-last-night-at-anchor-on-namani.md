Barring any major surprises this will be our last night at anchor aboard Namani. We had a nice 170nm sail from the Whitsundays up to here (Palm Islands, about 120nm south of Cairns). We'll start our last leg tomorrow (Wed, 30APR) morning and should make it into Cairns on Thursday.  We're glad we got this little 'encore' by delivering Namani up the coast. After Thursday the packing will begin in earnest...
