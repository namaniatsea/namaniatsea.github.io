Spent two nights tucked in between Motutapu and Rangitoto Islands to sit out the passage of a trough/front last night. Now the wind  starts to shift to the south (our only exposed direction) and we will move to the NE side of Motuihe this morning. It's been a while since we  had rain like this - probaby a welcome change for the Auckland area where it hasn't really rained since Christmas.
