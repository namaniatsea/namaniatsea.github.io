Under way to Anatom now, the southern most island  of Vanuatu. Exited the Navula Pass  out of Viti Levu's outer reef yesterday (Tue,  13AUG) afternoon around 1730 local time. A bit of bumpy start after that but now the wind has backed from SSE to SE, making for a more  comfortable ride. About 380nm to go. All is well aboard, stay tuned...
