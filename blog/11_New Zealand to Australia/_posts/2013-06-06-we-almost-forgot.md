..why are we doing this. But yesterday we were reminded again: a perfect day under sunny skies with a few tradewind clouds, sailing  smoothly under Parasailor, and catching a big mahi mahi as a bonus. Also a good chance for bathing day aboard Namani, where Nicky's  old inflatable kiddy pool (fits in our cockpit) serves as our onboard infinity pool. Happy and -for a change- clean faces all around. It looks like we will change our course slightly and head twoards Levuka rather than Savusavu as our port of entry because we received  word that the latter is currently full. Suits us well; Levuka is the former capital of Fiji, supposedly a nice little colonial gem. We might spend a  week or so around there and then continue to Savusavu once the crowds have cleared. All is well aboard - stay tuned...
