Originally we thought New Caledonia would only be a relatively short stop-over for us, assuming we would leave for Australia soon after  Nana's mother's visit at the beginning of October. Well, the weather hasn't been cooperating in terms of a stable window for the 850nm  passage to Coffs Harbour and - so far - we're mighty glad about it. We get to go to all those beautiful spots in New Caledonia's lagoon that  we otherwise would have missed. And we keep telling ourselves: much better to swim with the turtles than with the crocodiles...

We're anchored off Ilot Kouare now, after a few nice days in Ilot Mato. Kouare and Mato are both reef protected anchorages with clear  water, beautiful coral and good marine life (I guess that includes coral but we still ignorantly think of it as "landscape"). If the weather  cooperates we'll stay here until the end of the week, before heading back towards Noumea - assuming a departure window materializes  sometime next week. Of course it could all change at a moments notice - stay tuned...

PS: The image above shows Namani's tracks in New Caledonia's lagoon <em>after</em> we had originally expected to have departed for Australia...
