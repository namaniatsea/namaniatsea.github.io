Did I say the trades are back a few days ago?  Well that was short lived... after dealing with rain and thunder squalls all day yesterday (and  actually making good progress) we were becalmed 14 hrs during last night.  Now there is a gentle 10 knots of true wind from behind which  only gets us about 4.5 kn of boat speed with ~420 nm to go to Antigua - and even the occasional squalls don't provide much of a push  currently... hence our ETA now has slipped to Thursday morning.  On the bright side, it is a sunny day and we had a mink whale (as  correctly identified by Nicky) drifting right along side Namani for about 20 min this morning.  Stay tuned - we will get there eventually...
