After two days on Peaks Island we used the nice weather today for a sail a little further north and are now anchored off Snow Island in  Casco Bay.  It's very beautiful and quiet up here - definitely among the the nicest places we have dropped the hook in.  There is a group of  12 seals hanging out on a rock that's awash at low tide about 30 meters from our boat.

This spot is also said to have the warmest water in  Casco Bay (at 15-16ï¿½C that's a very relative statement...) so Nicky and Papa even braved a swim...  Unfortunately, the weather is expected  to get worse again before summer finally arrives so we may just head back to Peaks tomorrow and start to get the boat ready for haul-out  next week. Stay tuned...
