While we're still waiting for an engine repair (which will hopefully be completed tomorrow), we have time to upload some new material - including the photo above from our visit to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.  The new album in the photo gallery (see link on the right) is called "Puerto Rico to Florida".

Videos:  The first one is Nicky's on-board commentary en-route to the Turks and Caicos:

The next one shows Nana and Nicky during our open water swim call while becalmed after leaving Grand Turk Island:

Just to show that we also had some very nice sailing - a clip taken about 24 hrs later en route to the Bahamas (courtesy of Bill):

And last but not least: footage from our airboat ride in the Everglades last Thursday:

We hope to be under way again on Tuesday... stay tuned for updates...
