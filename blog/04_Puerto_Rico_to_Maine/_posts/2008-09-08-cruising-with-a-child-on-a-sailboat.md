When we began planning our trip in earnest, a big concern of ours was our son: how would Nicky handle life on Namani? How would we handle life with him in such a small space, and away from normal sources of child entertainment like kindergarden and his friends? Now that we have finished a year of sailing, we are glowing in our memories and our accomplishment as a family. We had a fantastic year, and are so glad we did it together and at this stage in our lives.
