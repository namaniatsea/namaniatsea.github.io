After 2 1/2 weeks (which included a 5-day trip back to Germany for Nicky and Markus to see Oma and Opa) we finally did say good bye to  Annapolis again. We started heading further south, planning to meet our friends from Boundless in Virginia tomorrow or on Sunday and then proceed towards Norfolk.

As in many places down the East Coast, colonial and early US history was lurking behind every corner.
