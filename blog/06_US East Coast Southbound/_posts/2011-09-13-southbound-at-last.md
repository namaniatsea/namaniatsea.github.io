Spent a day and night here before continuing south on Wednesday, destination Plymouth, MA. A very interesting place here, largely uninhabited, save for a research station and a Star Cooperation retreat (they own the main Island, now named Star Island). These Isles were the only spot that Captain John Smith (who coined the term New England in the 17th century) had originally named after himslef ("Smith Islands") but the name didn't stick...

Were glad to meet up with Bob and Maggie from Decoy who also arrived from Portland. They will head out again tonight already to make it to the Newport boatshow by the weekend.
