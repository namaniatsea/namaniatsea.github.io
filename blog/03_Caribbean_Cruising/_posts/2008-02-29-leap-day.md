Realized today that we picked the right year for our "sailing sabbatical" - 366 instead of 365 days!  

Finally made contact with Sven from Arearea this morning via SSB on 8 MHz (we had sailed in tandem for two month in the western Med).   They were about 400 nm from Antigua this morning and we look forward to seeing them again, hopefully in Guadeloupe.

We'll be leaving the Pitons tomorrow, slowly working our way back up the west coast of St. Lucia.
