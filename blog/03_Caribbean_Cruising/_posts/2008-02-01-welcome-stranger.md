When we put up this site it was originally intended to keep family and friends up to date.  Based on the summary statistics we receive about the blog (essentially number of visits per day by country) it seems there is now a wider audience (or a lot of our friends must have moved to far away places in the recent past...) - which is great and exciting!  We'd love to hear how you found this blog and what interests you the most to hear about. So if you don't mind please just leave a short comment - thanks!
