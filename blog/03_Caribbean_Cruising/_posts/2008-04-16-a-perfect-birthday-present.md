We're en route from Anguilla to Puerto Rico (or more exactly: to Culebra, an island just east of Puerto Rico) and Papa is enjoying the  perfect birthday present - a beautiful night sail, going wing-on-wing down-wind at an easy 5 knots with a poled out genoa and a reefed  main... a 3/4 moon lights up the secenery and the wind vane is steering happily again.  Next update from Puerto Rico - stay tuned...
