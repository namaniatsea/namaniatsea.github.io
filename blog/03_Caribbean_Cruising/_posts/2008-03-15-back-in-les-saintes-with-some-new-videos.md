Arrived in Les Saintes again yesterday witth Jez and Tab after a stop-over on Marie Galante.  Anchored off Le Bourg now, one of our favorite anchorages with very fond memories of our first stop here together with Sea Bright who have safely arrived in Bonaire a few days ago...

Below are some new videos from the last month, roughly in chronological order:

The first is a view of St. Georges on Grenada, taken by Laura from our dinghy:

The next one was taken in the Tobago Cays from a fishing boat that took us from a little excursion on Petit Tabac back through the Horseshoe Reef our anchorage:
