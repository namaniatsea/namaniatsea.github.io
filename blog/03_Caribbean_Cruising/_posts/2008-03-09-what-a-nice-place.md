Anchored in Prince Rupert Bay/Dominica tonight after a longish sail from St. Pierre/Martinique.  Prince Rupert Bay has been one of our  favorite anchorages on the way down and it's very nice to be back here... almost no shore-side development, very lush scenery and very  friendly people... met Jeffrey again who was our very first "boat boy" on the way down and will see him again for breakfast tomorrow.. this  will probably be the first place that I will feel sad about leaving tomorrow... lots of things to look forward to though, stay tuned....
