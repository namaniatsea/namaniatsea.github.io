Weighed anchor at 0600 this morning off Barbuda and dropped it 69 nm and almost 12 hrs later in White House Bay St. Kitts... a long day,  reminiscent of the Atlantic crossing - downwind sailing in big and somewhat confused seas... will likely stay put for a few days until seas  subside back to "normal" levels, probably next Monday... stay tuned
PS: Picture above was taken on the beach in Low Bay, Barbuda
